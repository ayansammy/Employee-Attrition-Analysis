# Employee Attrition Analysis of Glover Cooperation with Power BI

Explore the factors behind employee attrition through data visualization using Power BI. This analysis visualizes employee attrition patterns and trends using Power BI. 
Glover Co-operation has a substantial number of workers 1,479 with 9 different job roles. It has 3 departments.

## Objective

The primary aim is to explore why certain employees choose to leave and identify patterns that contribute to enhancing the workplace. Rather than delving into intricate numbers, the focus is on uncovering narratives concealed within the data.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset containing employee information, including demographics, job roles, and relevant performance metrics.

## Power BI Report
To investigate the reasons for the 16.22% of workers leaving the company, I built a comprehensive report dashboard to help identify the reasons behind this. 


1. Analysis was done to check various age groups per gender.
2. Also, the breakdown of employees by job roles and agenda is shown on the report dashboard.
3. It also shows how the employees are spread by departments and the breakdown of each gender within the 3 departments.
4. I also check how business travel influences attrition rate.
5. Analysis was done as well to see the gender and age group that are prevalent leaving the company.

## Usage

From the report dashboard, the following observations were made:

## Retention vs. Attrition Rates:

1. The retention rate is higher (83.88%) compared to the attrition rate (16.22%).
83.88% of total employees tend to stay in the company, while 16.22% leave for various reasons.

## Age Group Analysis:

2. Workers aged 26-35 constitute the most prevalent group (606 individuals).
Within this age group, males significantly outnumber females (368 compared to 238).

## Attrition Based on Age:

3. Individuals aged 18-25 exhibit the highest attrition rate due to business travel.
Females in this group have a higher attrition rate (41.86%) compared to males (32.50%).
Those aged 36-45 have the least attrition rate among age classes.

## Attrition and Travel:

4. Employees who travel frequently have a higher attrition rate.
This group tends to leave the company more than those who rarely travel or do not travel at all.

## Marital Status Impact:

5. Single workers tend to leave the company more frequently than their married counterparts.

## Job Roles and Departments:

6. Sales Executive is the highest-ranking position (326 individuals).
The Human Resources department has 52 workers.
In the Research & Development, there's a high number of workers, with a predominance of males.


## Conclusion:
- Based on the observations from the report dashboard, several key trends have emerged that provide valuable insights into the workforce dynamics within the company. Notably, the retention rate surpasses the attrition rate, indicating a generally stable employment environment. However, a closer examination reveals nuanced patterns related to age, travel, marital status, and departmental distribution.

## Recommendations:
Address Attrition in Younger Age Groups:
- Given the higher attrition rates among individuals aged 18-25, targeted strategies should be implemented to understand and mitigate the factors contributing to their departure, particularly related to business travel.

Employee Engagement for Frequent Travelers:
- Recognizing the elevated attrition rate among employees who travel frequently, efforts should be made to enhance the engagement and satisfaction of this group. This may include providing additional support, recognition, or incentives to mitigate potential burnout.

Support for Single Employees:
- Since the dashboard indicates that single workers tend to leave the company more frequently, consider implementing initiatives to provide additional support or benefits to this demographic, aiming to improve their overall job satisfaction and retention.

Diversity and Inclusion in Leadership:
- Acknowledging the gender disparity, particularly in certain age groups and departments, the company should explore initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion, especially in leadership positions. This could contribute to a more balanced and inclusive work environment.

Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:
- Establish regular monitoring mechanisms to track workforce dynamics and obtain employee feedback. This will facilitate the identification of emerging trends and allow for timely interventions to address potential issues.

Tailored Training and Development:
- Consider implementing targeted training and development programs, especially in departments with higher attrition rates, to enhance skills, job satisfaction, and career progression, ultimately contributing to employee retention.
