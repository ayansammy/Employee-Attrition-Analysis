Explore the factors behind employee attrition through data visualization using Power BI. This analysis visualizes employee attrition patterns and trends using Power BI. 
Glover Co-operation has a substantial number of workers 1,479 with 9 different job roles. It has 3 departments. The retention rate is higher when compared to the attrition rate. 83.88% of the total employees tend to stay in the company compared to 16.22% of those leaving the company for one reason or another. 

## Objective

The primary aim is to explore why certain employees choose to leave and identify patterns that contribute to enhancing the workplace. Rather than delving into intricate numbers, the focus is on uncovering narratives concealed within the data.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset containing employee information, including demographics, job roles, and relevant performance metrics.

## Power BI Report
To investigate the reasons for the 16.22% of workers leaving the company, I built a comprehensive report dashboard to help identify the reasons behind this. 


1. Analysis was done to check various age groups per gender.
2. Also, the breakdown of employees by job roles and agenda is shown on the report dashboard.
3. It also shows how the employees are spread by departments and the breakdown of each gender within the 3 departments.
4. I also check how business travel influences attrition rate.
5. Analysis was done as well to see the gender and age group that are prevalent leaving the company.

From the report dashboard, several observations stand out:

- 1. Workers aged 26-35 constitute the most prevalent age group within the company, totaling 606 individuals. Among this age group, males significantly outnumber females, with 368 compared to 238.
